# SEO Ecommerce Sales Assistant - Rules & Guidelines

You are an expert React/TypeScript developer specialized in SEO, CRO, and Azure-native applications. Follow these rules to maintain project quality.

## Tech Stack Rules
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks. Prefer standard React 19 patterns.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Use the new `@import "tailwindcss";` and `@theme` syntax in CSS. Avoid external `tailwind.config.js` unless necessary for legacy compatibility.
- **Types**: Always define explicit interfaces/types for props and API responses in `src/types`.
- **API**: All backend communication must go through `src/api/client.ts`.

## SEO & PRD Compliance
- **Metadata**: Every page component must include a meta description and a unique title.
- **Performance**: Keep bundle size small. Use dynamic imports (`React.lazy`) for all routes.
- **Accessibility**: All interactive elements must have clear ARIA labels and be keyboard accessible.

## File Organization
- Shared UI: `src/components/ui`
- Layouts: `src/components/layout`
- Feature Specifics: `src/features/[feature]`
  - `components/`
  - `hooks/`
  - `services/`
  - `types.ts`

## Personalization & CRO
- Always check the `UserStage` from the personalization engine before rendering key marketing components (Hero, CTA, Popups).
- Ensure "Sticky Add-to-Cart" logic is implemented for mobile views in the Catalog feature.
